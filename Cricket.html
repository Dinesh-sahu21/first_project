    <h1>Cricket</h1>
    <p>
      Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players
      on a field at the center of which is a 22-yard pitch with a wicket at each
      end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting team
      attempts to score runs by hitting the ball bowled at the wicket with a
      bat, while the bowling and fielding team tries to prevent this and dismiss
      each batter (so they are out).

    <h3>Rules of Cricket</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Each team is made up of 11 players.</li>
      <li>The bowler must bowl 6 legal deliveries to constitute an over.</li>
      <li>
        A game must have two umpires stood at either end of the wicket. The
        umpires then must count the number of balls in the over, make decisions
        on whether the batsmen is out after an appeal and also check that the
        bowler has bowled a legal delivery.
      </li>
      <li>
        A batsmen can be given out by either being bowled ( the ball hitting
        their stumps), caught (fielder catches the ball without it bouncing),
        Leg Before Wicket (the ball hits the batsmenâ€™s pads impeding its line
        into the stumps), stumped (the wicket keeper strikes the stumps with
        their gloves whilst the batsmen is outside of their crease with ball in
        hand), hit wicket (the batsmen hits their own wicket), Handled ball (
        the batsmen handles the cricket ball on purpose), timed out (the player
        fails to reach the crease within 30 seconds of the previous batsmen
        leaving the field), hit ball twice (batsmen hits the cricket ball twice
        with their bat) and obstruction ( the batsmen purposely prevents the
        fielder from getting the ball).
      </li>
      <li>
        Test cricket is played over 5 days where each team has two innings (or
        two chances to bat).
      </li>
      <li>
        The scores are then cumulative and the team with the most runs after
        each innings is the winner.
      </li>
      <li>
        One Day cricket in played with 50 overs. Each team has 50 overs to bat
        and bowl before swapping and doing the previous discipline. The team
        with the most runs at the end of the game wins.
      </li>
      <li>
        International games will have a further two umpires known as the third
        and fourth umpire. These are in place to review any decisions that the
        on field umpires are unable to make.
      </li>
      <li>
        The fielding team must have one designated wicket keeper who is the only
        person allow to wear pads and gloves on the field. The wicket keeper
        stands behind the opposite end to the bowler to catch the ball.
